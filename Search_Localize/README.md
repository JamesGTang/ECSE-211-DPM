# Robot hardware requirement 

#ToDo:
<ol>
<li>Reinforce front wheel axis</li>
<li>Added battery pack holder</li>
</ol>

## The robot must satifsfy the following functional requirements
<ol>
<li>The left and right motors should be made from the medium motor (the red ones), it is more precise</li>	
<li>Ultrasonic sensor is mounted on a medium motor and located at the front of the robot</li>
<li>Ultrasonic sensor is able to rotate from -90 degree to 90 degree unobstructed</li>
<li>Ultrasonic sensor should not exceed 10cm in height, ideally 6-9cm</li>
<li>Ultrasonic sensor should be mounted with vertically (one cirle is on top of the other)</li>
<li>Ultrasonic sensor should be mounted near on the center of of robot's wheel axis</li>
<li>One light sensor is mounted forward</li>
<li>One light sensor should be mounted downward, about 1cm from floor, located on center of the axis</li>
<li>The track length of the robot should be under 17cm</li>
</ol>	

## Improvement
The below improvements can aid robot's performance
<ol>
<li>The robot's left and right motor should be connected with a horizontal beam for stability</li>	
<li>The robot should use as little material as possible to reduce weight</li>
</ol>

 ## Wiring
 Sensors:
 <ol>
 <li>Ultrasonic sensor: Sensor Port S4</li>
 <li>Block light sensor (forward facing): Sensor Port S2</li>
 <li>Floor light sensor (downward facing): Sensor Port S3</li>
</ol>
 Motors:
  <ol>
  <li>Left motor: Motor Port D</li>
  <li>Right motor: Motor Port B</li>
  <li>Ultrasonic base motor: Motor Port C</li>
  </ol>
